# FeedHive
NewsLoader / Loader News or Feednews

#What's this?

It's very simple, it's a loader news or feednews, with the chance to make comments and put a finger up in a post; a took a version out of the internet of it, and turned out for me that I found several bugs, still, it's in beta here, but I resolved lots of issues. It's working partially, thought. Remember! you need to run MongoDB here.
